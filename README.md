# Guess the number game

Using Python, I programmed one game against AI. There are 2 possible games modes:

1. Human player tries to guess the number AI picks 
2. Human player chooses a number and AI tries to find it

Modules used: random

Topics covered: If statments, for loops, lists and input function

Any comments or suggestions are greatly appreciated!
